# Synatic Snippets

> Functions, code, and nifty tricks for assisting with data processing and integration on the Synatic Data Integration HUB.

Welcome to the Synatic Snippets Repository!

This is where the Synatic team and community collect and store code snippets which seek to improve performance, productivity, and value when using the Synatic platform.

## Library

The snippet library is segregated into various sections depending on the type of operation you want to perform.

### Snippets

This section is largely dedicated to the Synatic Calculator.

As you may know, the Synatic "Calculator Step" is the de facto standard mode of operation for performing data transformations and processing on Synatic. If you don't know about the Synatic Calculator, be sure to head over to Synatic.com and [Request a Demo](https://www.synatic.com/demo)!

Aside from demonstrating the usage of standard calc step operations, integrated helper utilities, and other platform specific functions, we include various other javascript based data processing and cleaning algorithms here as well.

### Queries

Synatic provides various data connectors, and here we include various copypasta ready lookup functions for retrieving data from buffers and a host of source systems, from SQL Server to Salesforce. Many of the queries are based on the [sql-to-mongo library](https://github.com/synatic/sql-to-mongo) and provide examples of the library in action within buffer lookup steps.

### Solutions

Sometimes it's more productive to just import an entire solution, including all the flows and buffers needed to execute end to end operations.

## Solution Store (Coming Soon)

The solution store is an upcoming platform integration which will allow for the frictionless implementation of end to end data processing and integration solutions directly on the platform, without the need to hassle with flat files.
